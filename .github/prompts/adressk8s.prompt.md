we now use flux to deploy on a kubernetes engine, its in the k8s folder but it seemes that the data source prometheus was not configured automaticly like the docker compose option,
btw once this is fixed, we should get rid of the docker compose and just update the readme to say its deploy via kubernetes or or we could keep the docker compose as backup for other options but who cares right
get rid as well of any unused files in the repo check all of them, the only goal of this repo is to provide a simple and efficient way to deploy and manage Grafana with metrics from my raspberry pi
